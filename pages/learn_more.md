# Recommended web pages
Here is a list of sites we find nice and good for learning more cyber security.

## Learning Security
* [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/) explains common 
vulnerabilities, and describes how to prevent them when coding.
* [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) 
is a YouTube channel containing lots of videos about "computers and 
computer stuff". 
* [Ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA/videos) is
another YouTube channel explaining walkthroughs for __retired__ "HackTheBox" machines.
He also offers great tips and tricks for penetration testing and how to get better at CTFs in
general. See [the section below](#nice-puzzles-for-learning-more-hacking) for more info about the pentesting lab "HackTheBox".
* [Liveoverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)
is a YouTube channel with loads of hacking and CTF videos.
* [GynvaelEN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCkVMojdBWS-JtH7TliWkVg) is a YouTuber from the CTF team Dragon Sector.
* [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw)
another YouTuber with CTF writeups.
* [How HTTPS Works](https://howhttps.works/) is a funny web page 
explaining how HTTPS works through a nice comic. 

### In Oslo/Norway
* UiO-CTF's practical workshops are very nice to learn how to solve CTF 
tasks. Every workshop takes a CTF category as a topic, and go through the 
steps of one or a few tasks within that category. Each workshop ends with 
a mini CTF with tasks of the topic. The workshops take place at the Department 
of Informatics, at University of Oslo, and are posted as events on their
[facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/uioctf).

### Learning pwn
* [BlackHoodie-2018-Workshop](https://github.com/tharina/BlackHoodie-2018-Workshop): 
supernice slides and challenges for learning introductions to pwn. 
Stack overflows, stack frame and short on ROP (return oriented programming)

## More CTFs
* [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) is a page containing most CTFs in the 
world. Most of these are quite hard, but sometimes there are very nice
beginner CTFs here as well. 
* [Major Cyber League](https://www.majorleaguecyber.org/), a new site like
CTFtime, where CTF's are posted and teams and users are ranked. It seems
like it is brand new, so some functionality is missing.
* [CTF Norge](https://discord.gg/P4X4WyN) on Discord posts a few university
CTFs now and then in the #ctf channel.
* Looking for a team (and live in Norway or are from Norway)? The 
university team [UiO-CTF](https://discord.gg/E24KzaJ) is more than happy 
to compete with you.
* [Norwegian Cyber Security Challenge](https://www.ntnu.no/ncsc) has an
open Jeopardy styled CTF once a year. The top teams under the age of 25
are invited to a final round having different challenges. The ones with 
hacking skills and the ability to hack in teams, are invited to join the 
Norwegian team for the European Cyber Security Challenge. 

## Nice puzzles for learning more hacking
* [Overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames) is a very nice website for 
different puzzles. The category __bandit__ has terminal puzzles and __narnia__ 
contains exploit intro puzzles.
* [Google gruyere](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/) is a cheesy vulnerable 
web app to learn web application exploits and defenses.
* [pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr/) contains exploit puzzles.
* [pwnable.tv](http://pwnable.tv/) contains exploit puzzles.
* [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1) crypto challenges contains, as 
its name says, crypto challenges.
* [Juice shop](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project), an 
intentionally insecure web page. 
* [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), "Hack The Box is an online platform 
allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and 
methodologies with other members of similar interests."
* [TGHack's old tasks](https://github.com/tghack) on github.
